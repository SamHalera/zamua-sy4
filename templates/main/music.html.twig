                    Music comes from a sense of urgency, from a need to share one's voice, soul, and presence.
                    <strong>A means of learning to think critically about what we see and do in the environment in which we live; </strong>
                    the beginning and end of a cyclical path toward self-determination.
                    It is a means of reaching people's emotions, conveying a picture, an idea, or a concept, and giving meaning to the perception of reality.
